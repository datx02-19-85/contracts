# Vote

This is our first smart contract. Just get the the coding started and try som solidity code and see how it works.

## What is it doing

The contract will allow only one person to perform a "vote" that is actully just calling a function called doVote(). This function will then increment a value and lock the function to be called again my using a modifier.
